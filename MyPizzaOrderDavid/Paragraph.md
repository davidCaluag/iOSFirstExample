# Paragraph

The project was fairly simple. I was able to start and finish it in class. I had the most problems with the UI and the segmented control. I resolved the segmented control by adding a simple '.style' modifier to the picker. This assignment helped cement my knowledge with NavigationView and NavigationLink. It also helped me fully understand value-type and @Binding. Lastly, this assignment gave me good practice in creating a simple UI.

I realized I needed to show a list of pizzas instead of an individual pizza. Because of this feature, the assignment ended up taking more time. While it took some time, it was fairly straight-forward. A lot of bugs, but they weren't complicated to straighten out.

## Overview

Overall, it was good and challenging but not difficult.
